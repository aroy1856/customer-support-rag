INTRODUCTION\n\nThis Fair Usage Policy (FUP) is designed to ensure that all our customers enjoy a consistent and high-quality internet experience. The policy applies to all unlimited data plans and is necessary to prevent network congestion and ensure equitable access to network resources for all users.\n\n2. WHAT IS FAIR USAGE POLICY?\n\nFair Usage Policy is a mechanism to manage network traffic and prevent excessive usage by a small number of users that could degrade service quality for others. While your plan offers unlimited data, the speed may be reduced after you consume a certain amount of high-speed data in a billing cycle.\n\n3. FUP LIMITS BY PLAN\n\nThe FUP limit varies based on your subscribed plan:\n\n- Basic Unlimited Plan: 1.5 GB per day high-speed data\n- Standard Unlimited Plan: 2 GB per day high-speed data\n- Premium Unlimited Plan: 3 GB per day high-speed data\n- Elite Unlimited Plan: 4 GB per day high-speed data\n\nAfter consuming your daily high-speed data limit, your internet speed will be reduced to 512 Kbps for the remainder of the day. The high-speed data quota resets at midnight every day.\n\n4. MONTHLY FUP CAPS\n\nIn addition to daily limits, some plans have monthly FUP caps:\n\n- Basic Unlimited Plan: 50 GB per month\n- Standard Unlimited Plan: 75 GB per month\n- Premium Unlimited Plan: 100 GB per month\n- Elite Unlimited Plan: 150 GB per month\n\nOnce you exceed the monthly limit, your speed will be throttled to 256 Kbps for the remainder of the billing cycle, regardless of daily quota availability.\n\n5. SPEED AFTER FUP LIMIT\n\nAfter reaching your FUP limit:\n- Daily limit exceeded: Speed reduced to 512 Kbps until midnight\n- Monthly limit exceeded: Speed reduced to 256 Kbps until next billing cycle\n- You can continue to use data without any additional charges\n- No data usage is blocked; only speed is reduced\n\n6.

POLICY UPDATES\n\nWe reserve the right to modify FUP limits based on network capacity, technology upgrades, and regulatory requirements. Any changes will be communicated at least 30 days in advance via SMS, email, and website notifications.\n\n15. ABUSE PREVENTION\n\nThe FUP is also designed to prevent abuse such as:\n- Commercial use of personal plans\n- Running servers or hosting services\n- Automated data scraping or bot activities\n- Reselling bandwidth to third parties\n\nViolation of these terms may result in service suspension or termination.\n\n16.

The policy applies to all unlimited data plans and is necessary to prevent network congestion and ensure equitable access to network resources for all users.\n\n2. WHAT IS FAIR USAGE POLICY?\n\nFair Usage Policy is a mechanism to manage network traffic and prevent excessive usage by a small number of users that could degrade service quality for others. While your plan offers unlimited data, the speed may be reduced after you consume a certain amount of high-speed data in a billing cycle.\n\n3. FUP LIMITS BY PLAN\n\nThe FUP limit varies based on your subscribed plan:\n\n- Basic Unlimited Plan: 1.5 GB per day high-speed data\n- Standard Unlimited Plan: 2 GB per day high-speed data\n- Premium Unlimited Plan: 3 GB per day high-speed data\n- Elite Unlimited Plan: 4 GB per day high-speed data\n\nAfter consuming your daily high-speed data limit, your internet speed will be reduced to 512 Kbps for the remainder of the day. The high-speed data quota resets at midnight every day.\n\n4. MONTHLY FUP CAPS\n\nIn addition to daily limits, some plans have monthly FUP caps:\n\n- Basic Unlimited Plan: 50 GB per month\n- Standard Unlimited Plan: 75 GB per month\n- Premium Unlimited Plan: 100 GB per month\n- Elite Unlimited Plan: 150 GB per month\n\nOnce you exceed the monthly limit, your speed will be throttled to 256 Kbps for the remainder of the billing cycle, regardless of daily quota availability.\n\n5. SPEED AFTER FUP LIMIT\n\nAfter reaching your FUP limit:\n- Daily limit exceeded: Speed reduced to 512 Kbps until midnight\n- Monthly limit exceeded: Speed reduced to 256 Kbps until next billing cycle\n- You can continue to use data without any additional charges\n- No data usage is blocked; only speed is reduced\n\n6.

TETHERING AND HOTSPOT USAGE\n\nUsing your mobile connection as a hotspot or for tethering is permitted but subject to FUP limits. Excessive tethering usage may be monitored, and if it significantly impacts network performance, additional restrictions may be applied.\n\n11.
